\ Hi, I’m Bee 👋🐝

I’m a production support software developer based in Toronto, Canada, working on mission-critical financial systems at IFC Canada.  
My work sits at the intersection of **software engineering, legacy systems, and production reliability** — building, monitoring, and supporting systems that have real business impact.

## Background
- 🎓 BSc in Computer Science (Honours), Wilfrid Laurier University — 2025
- 🇨🇦 Born and raised in Canada
- 🇦🇺 Dual citizen of Canada and Australia
- 🌏 Long-term goal: working as a software engineer in Melbourne

## What I do
- Production support and development of complex legacy and modern systems
- Operational monitoring and first-line incident response across SaaS platforms
- Triage, investigation, and resolution of production incidents and defects
- On-call participation, severity escalation, and major incident management
- Coordination with product owners, development teams, and service teams
- Participation in PIT testing and release-related validation

I work closely with real production data, real users, and real constraints — where correctness, traceability, and safe fixes matter more than perfect code.

## Systems & technologies I work with
**Languages & Runtime**
- Java, Python, SQL, PL/SQL

**Backend & Architecture**
- Spring Boot, Spring Framework
- REST APIs, SOAP web services
- JDBC, Hibernate
- Service-oriented architecture (SOA)

**Databases & Search**
- Oracle, MongoDB, ElasticSearch

**Infrastructure & DevOps**
- Red Hat OpenShift (OCP)
- Kubernetes
- Docker
- Jenkins
- Maven

**Production & Tooling**
- Dynatrace monitoring and alerting
- Automated smoke tests
- ServiceNow for incident, defect, and problem management

## How I think about engineering
- Production incidents are rarely caused by a single bug
- Good tooling reduces cognitive load during outages
- Legacy systems deserve the same engineering care as greenfield ones
- Reliability, debuggability, and clear communication matter more than cleverness

## What I’m building publicly
I’m intentionally expanding my GitHub portfolio with projects that reflect how I work in production:
- Incident analysis and observability tooling
- Backend services with clear APIs and data models
- Small systems that emphasize failure modes, tradeoffs, and operational clarity

Feel free to explore my pinned repositories — they’re designed to show *how I think*, not just what I can code.
